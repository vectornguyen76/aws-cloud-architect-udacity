Based on the architecture diagram, and the steps you have taken so far to upload data and access the application web service, identify at least 2 obvious poor practices as it relates to security.  Include justification.

1 IAM Role (InstanceRole) has full access to any s3 bucket instance. Again, violation of the
least privilege principle. Roles should be specific to the list of resources and actions
performed upon them.

2. The WebAppSG security group permits ingress traffic from the internet to multiple
   ports (including 22, 5000 and 80) exposing the server to attacks. It also
   allows all egress traffic to any IP address.
