# What additional architectural change can be made to reduce the internet facing attack surface of the web application instance.

Add CloudFront in front of the load balancer and make a rule that any ssh to instances should be done through AWS Systems Manager, which removes all external access to the instances.

# Assuming the IAM permissions for the S3 bucket are still insecure, would creating VPC private endpoints for S3 prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket.

Using VPC private endpoints alone would not prevent the unauthorized access to the secrets bucket

# Will applying default encryption setting to the s3 buckets encrypt the data that already exists?

No, only new objects will get affected by the modification.

# What would happen if the original cloud formation templates are applied to this environment.

All the configuration we made directly through the AWS management console to the original cloudformation configuration would be reset.
