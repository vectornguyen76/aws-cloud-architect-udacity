Research and analyze which of the vulnerabilities appear to be related to the code that was deployed for the environment in this project:

1. **IAM Policy Not Following the Principle of Least Privilege**: The deployed IAM policy grants full access to resources, violating the least privilege principle.
2. **Use of a Non-Root Account Not Enforced**: There is no enforcement to ensure the use of non-root accounts, which is a best practice for security.
3. **CloudTrail Trail Not Specified**: CloudTrail, which is crucial for logging and monitoring API activity, is not configured.
4. **Load Balancer Lacks HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: The application load balancer does not redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS, exposing data to potential interception.
5. **VPC Security Groups Allow All Ingress and Egress Traffic**: Security groups are too permissive, allowing all ingress and egress traffic, contrary to AWS recommendations.
6. **TCP Port 5000 Reachable from the Internet on EC2 Instance**: The EC2 instance is accessible from the internet on TCP port 5000, posing a security risk.
7. **S3 Buckets Lack Server-Side Encryption and Logging**: Server-side encryption and logging are not enabled for S3 buckets, which are important for data security and compliance.

Recommendations on how to remediate the vulnerabilities:

1. **Set IAM Policies**: Enforce the use of non-root accounts and enable multi-factor authentication (MFA). Define specific permissions based on roles and tasks to adhere to the principle of least privilege.
2. **Create a CloudTrail**: Configure CloudTrail to log and monitor API activity, and store the logs in an S3 bucket for audit and review purposes.
3. **Configure HTTP to HTTPS Redirection**: Set up the application load balancer to automatically redirect all HTTP requests to HTTPS, ensuring secure communication.
4. **Limit Traffic on Security Groups**: Restrict security group rules to allow only necessary traffic, such as ports 80 (HTTP) and 443 (HTTPS), and reference other security groups for internal communication within the VPC.
5. **Disable Unnecessary Ports on EC2 Instances**: Close all non-essential ports on the EC2 instance, particularly port 5000, to minimize exposure to potential attacks.
6. **Enable S3 Server-Side Encryption and Logging**: Activate server-side encryption and logging for all S3 buckets to protect data at rest and maintain comprehensive access logs.
